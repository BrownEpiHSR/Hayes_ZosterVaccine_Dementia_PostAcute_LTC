### Repository Overview

This repository contains three complementary analytical components examining the association between recombinant herpes zoster vaccination (RHZ) and incident dementia using a target trial emulation framework with clone–censor–weight methods and negative control calibration strategies.

This repository is organized into three main analytical folders. Each folder contains:

The folders are organized as follows:

1. Primary Analysis
* Code/ → R scripts used for clone–censor–weight implementation, model estimation, and bootstrapping
* Data Documentation/ → Excel files documenting the project details, data sources, covariates definitions used in the analysis

Purpose: 

Implements the main target trial emulation evaluating the association between RHZ vaccination and incident dementia.
